AI Usage Report
In this project, I used HuggingFace’s pre-trained model distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english through the transformers pipeline to perform sentiment classification on social media text and reviews.

The model is based on DistilBERT, a lighter and faster version of BERT, and was fine-tuned on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset. It outputs sentiment labels (POSITIVE / NEGATIVE) along with confidence scores.

This AI model replaced traditional lexicon-based methods like TextBlob, providing higher accuracy, especially on contextual, sarcastic, or ambiguous statements.

I integrated the model into a Streamlit dashboard, allowing users to analyze individual texts or bulk data from a CSV file. Visualizations were added using Matplotlib and Seaborn to show sentiment distribution.

AI tools like ChatGPT and HuggingFace’s model documentation helped me speed up development, structure the code, debug efficiently, and deliver a polished app within a short time.
